This repository contains the Limelight Networks SDK for Go. It provides a means to interact with the Limelight Networks APIs for the management of CDN configurations and EdgeFunctions.

At the present time, this SDK is provided only for the purpose of supporting the upcoming Limelight Networks Terraform Provider. Any use of the SDK outside of this context is unsupported, and the interface is subject to change.

If you have an interest in a fully featured and supported SDK for Go, please raise a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/llnw/llnw-sdk-go/issues/new) to track the feature request.
